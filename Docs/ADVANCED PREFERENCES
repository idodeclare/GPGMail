defaults write org.gpgtools.gpgmail UseOpenPGPInlineToSend -bool YES|NO

even if snippet generation is disabled in GPGMail preferences.

This option completely disables it.

defaults write org.gpgtools.gpgmail NeverCreatePreviewSnippets -bool YES|NO

By default OpenPGP is preferred if no better option is found.
Set this option to 2 to force S/MIME. 1 = OpenPGP.

defaults write org.gpgtools.gpgmail DefaultSecurityMethod -int 1|2

* Add a mapping for a missing UID to a public key. *

defaults write org.gpgtools.common PublicKeyUserMap -dict-add email fingerprint

* Disable OpenPGP for reading messages. *

defaults write org.gpgtools.gpgmail DisableOpenPGPForReading -bool YES|NO
